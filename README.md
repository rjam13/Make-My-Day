# Make My Day 

## Overview: 
Students in a class get one question a day by email or SMS or WhatsApp from their instructor at a time of their choice (e.g., morning 8 AM). By taking few minutes every day to answer one question, they improve their skills steadily throughout the semester. The questions are relevant to what is going on in class that week. If they give a correct answer, the system reinforces their answer and gives them more details.Otherwise, it tells when why they are wrong and tells them more information about the correct answer. There may also be optional reading material on the question for the student to learn more.
